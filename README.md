**This is the research work, submitted as part of the Final Thesis submission as part of my course**

The repository contains the pdf files for the project proposal and final thesis report. Please refer to these file for an insight about the scope of this project.
Below you shall find a breif explaination on how to excute the software. Please refer to the report for an in-depth undersatnding on implemetation of the software. 

Within the submission folder you shall find testing.py. The code has detailed comments that will be usefull when you implement it on your systems. 
Please note a model fine is not in this and shall be uploaded the near future. Meanwhile shal suggest you to run your own model.

The software can be used to train agents in differnt environment from Faram Gymnasium package. From the scope of this project, as the attempt was to test the usabilty of inertial mechanical tail with differnt gaits and morphologies, differnt environment can be choosen to train your agent. Please note the constrains for the environment have been predefined by Farama and minor change can made to suit your implementation. The cheetah environment can be used to train a quadrapod and the humanoid environment can used to train human morphology.

NOTE : At this point the repository is not complete and progress is being made in to finish as soon as possible
